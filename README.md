## General

This is a FrontEndMentor intermediate project example to train on responsive web design.
This is following the tutorial of @KevinJPowell on his YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/kevinpowell.

## Technologies

- Vite: setting up the environment (minimal use)
- Microsoft PowerToys: the color picker app was very useful in accurately getting the colors needed in the project.
- VSCode: my go-to IDE for coding.

## Installation

- Get the files. 
- Make sure npm package manager is installed on the machine.
- Open the project folder in VSCode
- Open the terminal in the project directory (shortcut: ctrl+shift+`)
- Type 'npm install' to install all the dependencies the project needs.
- Type 'npm run dev' to run the website in a development environment.
- Type the link that shows up in the terminal in your browser.
- Enjoy the experience of editing to see the  changes happen in real time.

## Shortcuts Learned

- 'ctrl+/' on selected lines to make them a comment.
- 'ctrl+d' on selection that repeats on multiple lines to put the cursor on these line.
- 'ctrl+f' to find the needed word.

## Tips Learned
- Get a CSS reset repo to clear all prebuilt CSS.
- Make root psudo-class to define the main properties of the site (font-weight, font-size, font-family, color) as variables.
- Make utility classes to easily use main properties.
- Put utility classes at the bottom of CSS file so it can't be overridden by other styles.
- Style for mobile first and use media queries efficiently.
